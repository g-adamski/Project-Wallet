# WALLET 12/2023 project: Manual testing of web application

## :information_desk_person: About project

<p align="justify">Wallet is a 1-week project as an end exam of course organised by <a href="https://goit.global/pl/" target="_blank">GoIT</a>. During the project, I had the opportunity to learn basic knowledge of the API testing, get to know the Postman tool, create my own collections based on Trello documentation.
